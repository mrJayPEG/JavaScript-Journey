//BITWISE OPERATORS

// 1 = 00000001 -> 8 bit -> 1 byte
// 2 = 00000010  
// 3 = 00000011

console.log(1 || 2); // Bitwise OR 
console.log(1 & 2); // Bitwise AND


/*
For the Bitwise OR calculation, if the binary notation of any of the operand is 1, the result prints 1, 
or else it prints 0. Now the final result in binary from is then transfromed to decimal

For the Bitwise AND calculation, same principles apply but both operands has to be 1 for the result to print out 1
